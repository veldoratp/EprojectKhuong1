            <div>American Idol</div>
            <div>2002</div>
            <div>descibe:American Idol is an American music competition and reality television show. The contest began
                to be held on June 11, 2002 and is one of the most popular television programs in the United States.
                American Idol is licensed from the British show Pop Idol, founded by producer Simon Fuller. American
                Idol was founded with the purpose of finding the most promising singers in the United States through a
                series of auditions held around the country. After that, the finalists will be decided by the audience's
                vote by phone. One feature of the program is that after the contestants' performances, the judges will
                give their own comments to help the audience orient the contestant they voted for. American Idol
                contestants must be able to sing and not currently have any recording contract or be under the
                management of a music organization. They must be US citizens or foreigners working in the US for a long
                time.For the first three years, American Idol contestants had to be between the ages of 16 and 24. But
                from the fourth year, the competition raised the age limit to 28 to attract more experienced
                contestants. . American Idol begins with tens of thousands of contestants, who will be interviewed and
                eliminated before auditioning with the show's two producers, Ken Warwick and Nigel Lithgoe. After that,
                they will be able to attend the official audition round with the three main judges of the show. In
                Hollywood, contestants selected through auditions around the United States will continue to test for
                several days, and many contestants will be eliminated by the judges. In the semi-finals, the selected
                contestants will be divided into groups. Each panel consists of multiple singers and all contestants in
                the same group will perform on the same night. From this round, the judges only have the role of
                commenting on the contestants, and the decision is entirely up to the audience's votes by telegram. The
                top two or three contestants from each group will be selected for the final round. The final round of
                American Idol competition took place for 11 consecutive weeks. During each week, the contestants will
                have to choose songs to perform according to the theme. The themes here can be different genres of
                music. In general, American Idol is the starting point for many young singers to achieve success in
                their later careers.</div>

            <div>2016</div>
            <div>Describe:Sing My Song is a reality TV show that searches for versatile artists who can compose and sing
                well. The program is organized with the aim of finding, fostering and developing generations of
                multi-talented musicians and singers (artists). The contestants selected for the recording round will be
                supported by the Organizing Committee in ability training, product release, image building and media
                sponsorship. The program has been distributed to more than 30 countries around the world and in Asia,
                first being broadcast in China with an overwhelmingly high rating and overwhelming compared to The Voice
                of China. In 2016, the program was copyrighted by Cat Tien Sa Company with the name Best Song and
                broadcast in Vietnam on channel VTV3. In the pre-qualification round, the candidates will send their
                documents and songs to register for the contest online and the organizers will select the best songs to
                enter the Recording round.In this round of recording, the contestants will perform their songs, while
                the coaches are not allowed to directly see the contestants' performances, but are blocked by a large
                screen that plays the lyrics. If the coach feels satisfied with the melody and content of the song, they
                will push the red lever in front of their face to receive the recording of the song being performed, and
                immediately the screen in front of the coach will go down. At the end, all screens are lowered for the
                judges to interact with the contestants. In the event that two or more judges choose the same candidate,
                the judges will have to compete for the contestant, but of course the final decision is in the hands of
                the contestant. The format of this exam is similar to the Hidden Face round of the Vietnamese vocal
                program. At the end of this round, 32 performances will be selected by four teams of four coaches, 8
                contestants each. Composing and competing rounds each coach will come up with a theme for their album.
                Eight contestants of each team were divided into four pairs by lottery, each pair of two contestants
                composing the same theme of the album and sharing a separate room within 24 hours. At the end of 24
                hours, all eight contestants will in turn perform a demo for the coach and mentor. Each team will have a
                guest with the role of an advisor who will work with the coach to help the contestants complete their
                song. The coach will choose a representative from each pair to be sure to advance to the Competition
                round to perform the newly composed song in front of other coaches and the panel of experts. Of the
                remaining four contestants, the special advisor will select one more contestant to advance to the
                Competition round. At the end of the Composing round, each team has five contestants to advance and
                three contestants to be eliminated. The contestant who gets 16 votes first will become the first
                season's Best Song Champion.</div>
